 Full 2025–26 season backtest
Use the --full-season flag:
python scripts/backtest_nba_spread.py --project learned-pier-478122-p7 --full-season --output-csv backtest_results.csv
This runs from 2025-10-22 through yesterday. For a custom range:
python scripts/backtest_nba_spread.py --project learned-pier-478122-p7 \  --start-date 2025-10-22 \  --end-date 2026-02-14 \  --output-csv backtest_results.csv
2. Picks for today / next few days
Use the new predict_nba_picks.py script:
# Today onlypython scripts/predict_nba_picks.py --project learned-pier-478122-p7# Next 3 dayspython scripts/predict_nba_picks.py --project learned-pier-478122-p7 --days 3# Next 7 dayspython scripts/predict_nba_picks.py --project learned-pier-478122-p7 --days 7# Specific datepython scripts/predict_nba_picks.py --project learned-pier-478122-p7 --date 2026-02-16 --days 3# Stricter filters (from backtest)python scripts/predict_nba_picks.py --project learned-pier-478122-p7 --days 3 --edge-threshold 1.0 --min-confidence 0.4
Output: For each game it prints:
BET lines when edge and confidence pass the thresholds
All games with model spread, book spread (if available), and edge
Odds: Picks use odds from raw_nba_odds (Pinnacle and historical CSV). If there are no odds for upcoming games, it prints Book N/A and you add them manually. For live use, you’d scrape or fetch odds daily.
